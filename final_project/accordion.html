    <button class="accordion">My First Knife</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>My first knife was given to me as a gift on or shortly after my 8th
            birthday. I was excited to use it in Cub Scouts. I am sure I was
            required to pass some sort of safety knowledge test to be permitted
            to carry and use a knife. The Diamond Edge brand This pocket knife
            originally came with side scales covered in a black celluloid-like
            plastic material. This material soon cracked, so I tore it all off.
            One of my first memories using this knife was cutting string from
            bales of hay on my grandfather’s farm. I also have distinct memories
            of using this knife contrary to my early instruction in knife
            safety. I had a leather belt and needed to make an extra hole. I
            placed the belt on my desk, in my room and began to use the main
            blade to bore a hole. The blade closed on the end of my left thumb,
            parallel to the bone. I still carry the scar of that injury. The
            experience has changed how I hold and use knives (and care for
            wounds) to this day.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Brazilian Souvenir</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>I purchased this knife as a souvenir before returning home in 1992
            from a two-year service experience in Brazil. I got it from a
            typical souvenir shop. Knives like this were commonly made by street
            artisans in northern Brazil for tourists. It is a cheap kitchen
            knife covered in epoxy putty, colored with local/natural pigments
            and decorated with local natural materials. Seeds (red), bones, fish
            teeth, and a snail shell adorn the sculpted epoxy. The sheath and
            handle are covered with snake skin. Happily, the US Customs service
            had nothing to say about it when I reentered the US in Florida.
            Simpler times. Unfortunately, the same was not the case for a
            co-traveler who decided to try and bring a small, beautiful mauve
            colored boa constrictor to the US, tied in a sock.</p>

    <button class="accordion">The First Knife I Bought for Myself</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>I bought this knife when I was fourteen and in the Varsity Scout
            program. I felt that I needed a cooler knife for camping and
            something light for hiking. Similar styles with brass and wood
            scales were very popular among my peers, larger being more
            desirable. I bought it at the local Army/Navy surplus store. It came
            in a forest green and black sheath (not pictured) with a Velcro
            closure flap. I was so excited to have my new knife. I took it home,
            sharpened it to a fine edge. It was sharp enough to shave hair from
            my forearm. I went outside to test it. Almost immediately I decided
            to throw the knife and stick the blade into our wood playhouse.
            Throw the knife? What was I thinking? It was NOT a good idea. An
            eighth inch length at the tip of the blade bent 90° as the metal
            entered the wood paneling and the momentum of the throw forced the
            rest of the knife to one side. My heart skipped a beat. I berated
            myself for being so stupid with my brand-new knife. I gently
            hammered the tip back into place and never did that again. I used
            this knife for years as a teen and young adult, especially for
            camping.</p>
