        <h3>Site Map</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction: (As stated below in the Site Purpose and Goals.) I will also introduce myself.  I am a middle aged, happily married father of four, working in the healthcare informatics workspace. I grew up carrying and using knives as often as possible.  I've casually built a collection of knifes.</li>
          <li>I like certain knives more than others.  Some styles really speak to my personal aesthetic.  I hold a deep appreciation for knives as a tool in everyday life, as well as camping and other outdoors activities.  I have a very frugal perspective when it comes to knife ownership:  I favor models that are easily affordable.  I appreciate beauty in the form knifemakers give to their creations. I value knives that are durable, useful, and designed with more than current fashion in mind.  While I appreciate inexpensive knives, I also avoid those that clearly are a waste of time and money.</li>
          <li>I will begin each knife feature with a profile.  This will include a picture of the knife, size, configuration, and other details describing the knife.</li>
          <li>The primary information I want to convey is a story about each knife I own.  I will tell the reader how and when I got each knife, what I like about each, and how I like to use this knife. I will include details from the history of my ownership of each example.</li>
          <li>Generally, I will provide information on caring for a knife, safety rules, and how to sharpen a knife.</li>
          <li>I may also suggest things the reader may appreciate if they consider owning a knife like mine.  This portion of the narrative may or may not include links to current purchase options or to similarly configured knives.</li>

        <h3>Site Purpose and Goals</h3>
        <p>
          I've liked knives since I received my first pocket knife as a Cub<br />
          Scout on my 8th birthday. Over the years I have casually collected<br />
          many knives. Some were gifts, others purchased or found. Each knife<br />
          has a story behind it. I want to tell their stories. I will
          showcase<br />
          my favorite knives and tell you what I like about each. <br />
          Would you like to see a few?
          <br /><br />
          This website will provide information and stories behind my favorite
          knives, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            "What was the first knife you owned and how old were you when you
            got it?"
          </li>
          <li>"Do you have a favorite knife?"</li>
          <li>"Do you have different knives for different purposes?"</li>
          <li>"What are my thoughts on knives as a useful tool?"</li>
          <li>"Have you ever injured yourself while using a knife?"</li>
          <li>"Where do you get your knives?"</li>
          <li>"What are your thoughts on how much to spend on a knife?"</li>
        </ul>
