          <h4>My First Knife</h4>
          <p class="story">
            My first knife was given to me as a gift on or shortly after my 8th
            birthday. I was excited to use it in Cub Scouts. I am sure I was
            required to pass some sort of safety knowledge test to be permitted
            to carry and use a knife. The Diamond Edge brand This pocket knife
            originally came with side scales covered in a black celluloid-like
            plastic material. This material soon cracked, so I tore it all off.
            One of my first memories using this knife was cutting string from
            bales of hay on my grandfather’s farm. I also have distinct memories
            of using this knife contrary to my early instruction in knife
            safety. I had a leather belt and needed to make an extra hole. I
            placed the belt on my desk, in my room and began to use the main
            blade to bore a hole. The blade closed on the end of my left thumb,
            parallel to the bone. I still carry the scar of that injury. The
            experience has changed how I hold and use knives (and care for
            wounds) to this day.

          <h4>Brazilian Souvenir</h4>
          <p class="story">
            I purchased this knife as a souvenir before returning home in 1992
            from a two-year service experience in Brazil. I got it from a
            typical souvenir shop. Knives like this were commonly made by street
            artisans in northern Brazil for tourists. It is a cheap kitchen
            knife covered in epoxy putty, colored with local/natural pigments
            and decorated with local natural materials. Seeds (red), bones, fish
            teeth, and a snail shell adorn the sculpted epoxy. The sheath and
            handle are covered with snake skin. Happily, the US Customs service
            had nothing to say about it when I reentered the US in Florida.
            Simpler times. Unfortunately, the same was not the case for a
            co-traveler who decided to try and bring a small, beautiful mauve
            colored boa constrictor to the US, tied in a sock.

          <h4>The First Knife I Bought for Myself</h4>
          <p class="story">
            I bought this knife when I was fourteen and in the Varsity Scout
            program. I felt that I needed a cooler knife for camping and
            something light for hiking. Similar styles with brass and wood
            scales were very popular among my peers, larger being more
            desirable. I bought it at the local Army/Navy surplus store. It came
            in a forest green and black sheath (not pictured) with a Velcro
            closure flap. I was so excited to have my new knife. I took it home,
            sharpened it to a fine edge. It was sharp enough to shave hair from
            my forearm. I went outside to test it. Almost immediately I decided
            to throw the knife and stick the blade into our wood playhouse.
            Throw the knife? What was I thinking? It was NOT a good idea. An
            eighth inch length at the tip of the blade bent 90° as the metal
            entered the wood paneling and the momentum of the throw forced the
            rest of the knife to one side. My heart skipped a beat. I berated
            myself for being so stupid with my brand-new knife. I gently
            hammered the tip back into place and never did that again. I used
            this knife for years as a teen and young adult, especially for
            camping.

          <h4>The Hunting Knife I Forged</h4>
          <p class="story">
            I forged this knife in 2021. The occasion was my 50th birthday. I
            traveled to be near my brothers and new son-in-law. I arranged to
            make hunting knives with them at the Stone Fox Forge in Orem, Utah.
            The blacksmith gave each of us a steel blank band. We heated the
            metal in small propane forges, until they glowed yellow. He taught
            us how to hammer out the shape of the blade and tang in a stepwise
            manner. After we were satisfied, the blacksmith helped us grind and
            sharpen the blades. The handles are wrapped in paracord. To finish
            off the evening, we took turns filming ourselves slice through water
            bottles with the newly formed blades. We continued that activity at
            home for days. It was a ton of fun. The experience was
            unforgettable.

          <h4>A Hunting Knife from a Kit</h4>
          <p class="story">
            I assembled and finished this knife during a summer wood shop
            program when I was fifteen. The program gave participants an
            opportunity to do two projects. I had taken wood shop as an elective
            class during the school year. I was very excited to learn one
            available project was to ‘make’ a hunting knife from a list of
            available kits. I chose the larges available and paid $30 or so to
            buy the kit. The woodworking aspect of the project was simply to
            shape and finish the handle. The handle wood came with the kit, in a
            left and right half. I cut the handle to my desired shape with a
            band saw. At the time, deeply scalloped handle grips were popular. I
            was concerned that I wouldn’t get the contours just right for my
            hand, so I kept it simple. After the handle was shaped, I glued the
            halves together, sanded, and stained it. Assembly was very simple.
            The tang of the blade inserts through the brass bolster, into a
            channel in the handle and onto the bolster. A round brass nut
            secures the whole assembly. The sheath shown in the picture was made
            at the same time, and came as part of the kit. My kind but stern
            shop teacher, Mr. Ohlwheiler had some brass brads in the shop. He
            showed me how to use them to strengthen the corners of the sheath
            where the stitching ended. While I chose this knife for its size,
            this same characteristic has kept me from using the knife much. As
            an adult I decided to give this blade a good sharpening. I sharpened
            both the bottom edge and top swage edge. Being unaccustomed to a
            sharp upper edge, I soon cut myself. I decided to dull the top edge
            and prevent further incidents.

          <h4>Refurbished Hunting Knife</h4>
          <p class="story">
            I found this knife while deer hunting on my grandfather’s mountain
            property, “Gooseberry”. Did we ‘get our deer’? No. The blade was
            sitting in the dirt along the top of a ridge bordering the eastern
            property line. We often found fragments of Native American pottery
            along the same ridge. When I found it, the knife was severely
            corroded. Its tang had been covered with rounded layers of leather
            and some other material to form a handle. This had all but
            completely rotted away. There was an iron bolster at the end of the
            handle. I took the knife to the same summer woodworking program I
            made the kit hunting knife in. There I refurbished the knife. I
            chose Zebra wood to make the handle. Brass brads to secure the
            handle were again furnished by my shop teacher. I tried to make a
            slightly more sculpted handle on this knife. I remember taking time
            to determine where my fingers would line up along its length.

          <h4>My Latest Purchase</h4>
          <p class="story">
            I bought this knife in 2021, as a birthday present for myself. I
            noticed the knife while browsing casually online, and fell in love
            with its shape and construction. The blade has a 1/4 inch flare at
            the base of the blade that acts as a small finger guard when open.
            When closed, this same construct protrudes from the back of the
            handle, providing a lever to assist opening the blade. The
            manufacturer offers this knife with several options for scale color
            and blade finish. This type of construction is sometimes referred to
            as a ‘flipper’, because it has a design feature which helps the user
            open the blade easily. This knife inspired me to shape my forged
            hunting knife with a similar trailing point blade.

          <h4>Watermelon Slicer</h4>
          <p class="story">
            I bought this machete as a present for my Dad when I was about 16. It
            came from the same Army/Navy surplus store where I bought my
            first knife. My teenage mind thought it would be extra cool to give
            him a large knife to cut watermelons with. It was summer. We ate
            watermelons aplenty. Why not? I think he tried it once, but
            let’s face it: the blade is nowhere as convenient as a kitchen knife
            when you are preparing food. Who wants to go out to the shed or
            garage to retrieve the machete just to slice a melon. Beside that,
            the blade isn’t ground in the same way a slicing knife is ground. It
            really isn’t very wieldy and tends to slice a curved path through
            melons. Yes, I tried. Oh well. In later years my Dad gave it back to
            me. You may guess from the picture that I no longer slice food with
            it. I use it every chance I get to prune bushes and whack weeds.
            Incidentally, in Brazil I occasionally observed people using
            machetes to ‘mow’ sections of lawn. The common working model
            typically was around 20-24” in length. I purchased one made by
            Tramontina for myself to bring back from Brazil. Alas, it was too
            big for my suitcase. I gave it away. Do I want another? Yes, yes I
            do.

            This knife is my current favorite. I suppose you could say I
            purchased this knife. I came across it for the first time in the
            basement of the first house I bought. I was in the process of
            finishing the basement. The knife had been hidden on top of heating
            ducts in the basement ceiling. I just happened to reach up and feel
            it there one day. Who knows how long it had been there or under what
            circumstances it came to rest? I’m glad I found it. I carry it every
            day. The quality of construction is just as one would expect from
            Victorinox. The can opener and awl have sharpened edges. The blade
            is thick along the spine and tapered toward the tip. The handle has
            a small steel ring to accommodate a lanyard. As seen in the picture,
            I use a piece of paracord tied with a diamond knot as my lanyard.
            Similar models are available currently in Victorinox’s Pioneer line.
